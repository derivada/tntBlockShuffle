# tntBlockShuffle

This is the source coude for **tntpablo's BlockShuffle** *Spigot* plugin that aims to recreate and *expand* the minigame features in Dream BlockShuffle YT Series

This project is a recreation with pure educational and recreational motivations and does not want to profit comercially from Dream or others original ideas.

To get this plugin in your server, simply install *Spigot 1.16* and put the .jar located at the target folder. You can configure the plugin by tweaking the options in *otherconfig.yml* and the block list in *blocks.yml*

This plugin is still **in development** but it should work with limited features as it is right now.
